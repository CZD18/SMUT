# SMUT
Pipeline for RNA-seq and SNP analysis from S. mutans

This pipeline was developed to determine the presence of Single Nucleotie Variants from RNA-seq. The data used is Public acces Bioproject: PRJNA301970 (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA301970). 

Objective: The objetive is to determine the variants of nucleotides and aminoacid mutations. This would determine the changes due the substrate used in the experiment done by Zeng L et al.(2016)
